# NestJS Learning Project: Understanding Workers, Event Loop, and PM2

## Introduction

This repository contains my exploratory project with NestJS, focusing on understanding the concepts of worker threads, the event loop, and how to manage Node.js processes with PM2. The inspiration and guidance for this project came from a [comprehensive tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cNIsBTg8HA), which delves into these concepts in detail.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of the following key concepts in Node.js and how they can be leveraged in a NestJS application:

- **Worker Threads:** Implementing worker threads to handle CPU-intensive tasks, thereby improving the performance and scalability of the application.
- **Event Loop:** Understanding how the event loop works in Node.js and its role in handling asynchronous operations.
- **PM2:** Learning to use PM2, a powerful process manager for Node.js applications, to ensure the application remains alive forever and facilitate common system admin tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harbouli/workers-pm2.git
```

## Learnings and Reflections

Throughout this project, I delved deep into the inner workings of Node.js, especially understanding how worker threads and the event loop can significantly impact the performance of a web application. PM2 emerged as a robust tool for process management, offering insights into application monitoring and load balancing.

The [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cNIsBTg8HA) was instrumental in guiding this learning journey, providing practical examples and in-depth explanations of these complex topics.

## Acknowledgments

- A heartfelt thank you to Michael Guay for creating the insightful [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cNIsBTg8HA) that guided me through understanding the complex concepts of worker threads, the event loop, and PM2 in Node.js. His explanations and practical examples were instrumental in the success of this learning project.
